/// change as a whole if any entry does not resolve. The backend only decides *how* a multi-level change is
/// materialised on screen:
/// - ``ZNavigationBackend/navigationStack``: pure pushes and pure pops of any depth are assigned once; a change that
///   replaces an entry at the same depth is pop now, push after ``staggerDelay``, because `NavigationStack` drops the
///   new entry when both happen in one change.
/// - ``ZNavigationBackend/navigationView``: pops are applied at once, pushes one per run-loop turn with a delay
///   between them (the FlowStacks `withDelaysIfUnsupported` technique).
///
/// What is on screen is ``materialised``; both containers are driven by it.
///
/// ``stack`` itself is always set to the target immediately, so observers (page views, breadcrumbs) see exactly one
/// change per navigation on both backends.
